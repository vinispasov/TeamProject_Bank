# Project description

For our project we choose to create an application depicting the day-to-day operations of a Bank institution.
Our application allows the creation of one or more "Bank" units and their clients. We have created a variety
of financial instruments that the clients can use. Those include different types of credit, deposits, bank card
(debit or credit) and investment bonds. Each instrument offers different terms and conditions to realistically
represent the corresponding financial instrument. The terms of the different bank product depend on the type of
the product, the type of the client and the additional parameters that the client can choose such as the amount
and duration of the product.
